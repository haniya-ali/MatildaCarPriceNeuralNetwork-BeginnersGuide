# MatildaCarPricePredictor-BeginnersGuide

**Description**
MatildaCarPricePredictor-BeginnersGuide combines the world of Matilda, a beloved character from Roald Dahl's imagination, with the cutting-edge technology of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This project serves as an introduction to neural networks for beginners by reflecting on Matilda's unique ability to recognize patterns.

**Problem Statement**
Matilda's father, Mr. Harry Wormwood, is an infamous car dealer. Ever since she was a young child, she has overheard various conversations on car deals, and thus, she is well-versed in the field. As a child, she once surprised her parents with a quick calculation of the profit from one of her father's cars.

As Matilda matures into a woman with a keen interest in the family business, she encounters the multifaceted nature of the car industry. Despite her innate ability to automatically discern patterns, a question arises: what if we could replicate this unique skill in a computer and train it to recognize patterns within the data from Matilda's car industry clients?

**Objective**
Since Matilda's mind possesses all the cognitive components necessary for carrying out complex tasks, such as recognizing patterns, we aim to emulate and harness this extraordinary ability within the realm of artificial neural networks. This project introduces the human neuron, delving into its anatomy and functionality, and discusses how these biological principles can be translated into computational frameworks. The objective is to provide a clear understanding of the foundational concepts of neural networks and guide beginners through the process of building and comprehending artificial neural networks.

**Project Components**
The project is divided into the following parts:

1. Introduction to Neural Networks: A beginner-friendly explanation of neural networks, artificial neurons, and the basics of machine learning.
2. Introduction to the Dataset: Exploring the dataset used in the project, understanding the features and variables that contribute to predicting car sale prices.
3. Data Visualizations: Visualizing key aspects of the dataset to gain insights and understand the relationships between variables.
4. Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
5. Creation of the Model: Building an artificial neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras, inspired by Matilda's intuitive understanding of patterns.
5. Evaluation of the Model: Assessing the model's performance, analyzing results, and interpreting the predictive capabilities of the neural network.
6. Conclusion and Resources for Further Studying: Summarizing key findings, and lessons learned, and providing additional resources for beginners to continue exploring the fascinating world of neural networks.

**Dataset** 
The dataset used in this project was sourced from the [Course Name] on Udemy, provided by [Instructor Name]. The course can be found at [Udemy Course Link].
The goal is that as a car salesman, we would like to develop a model to predict the total dollar amount that customers are willing to pay given the following attributes: 
- Customer Name
- Customer e-mail
- Country
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Salary 
- Credit Card Debt 
- Net Worth 

In summary given the above attributes, the model should predict: 
- Car Purchase Amount



Note: The character of Matilda belongs to Roald Dahl and is featured in the book "Matilda" written in 1988. The images depicting scenes from the project are sourced from the 1996 movie adaptation of the book. The unique quirks and characteristics of the character Matilda are the creative property of the author Roald Dahl. This project uses the character Matilda for creative inspiration and storytelling purposes, and it is not associated with or endorsed by the Roald Dahl estate or any affiliated parties. The primary focus of this project is to explore the integration of Matilda's fictional attributes into the context of artificial neural networks for car price prediction.
