# MatildaCarPricePredictor-BeginnersGuide

**DESCRIPTION**

Step into the magical world of MatildaCarPricePredictor! Imagine Matilda, the clever girl from Roald Dahl's stories. She's all grown up now and navigating the exciting world of cars with her dad, Mr. Harry Wormwood, a famous car dealer.

Inspired by Matilda's amazing brainpower, this project invites beginners to explore the basics of artificial neural networksâ€”fancy tech that learns patterns, just like Matilda did in her own way. Together, we'll use this cool technology to predict car prices, blending Matilda's unique charm with the wonders of data science.

Whether you're a fan of Matilda's adventures or just curious about AI, MatildaCarPricePredictor promises a fun and easy journey into the world of neural networks. Let's make predictions and have some data magic! ðŸš—âœ¨

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Matilda's father, Mr. Harry Wormwood, is an infamous car dealer. Ever since she was a young child, she has overheard various conversations on car deals, and thus, she is well-versed in the field. As a child, she once surprised her parents with a quick calculation of the profit from one of her father's cars.

As Matilda matures into a woman with a keen interest in the family business, she encounters the multifaceted nature of the car industry. Despite her innate ability to automatically discern patterns, a question arises: what if we could replicate this unique skill in a computer and train it to recognize patterns within the data from Matilda's car industry clients?

**OBJECTIVE**

As Matilda navigates the car industry and uses the attributes of her customers to increase her sales, we too can harness Matilda's exceptional cognitive abilities as inspiration to delve into the fundamentals of neural networks. To this end, **the objective of this project will be to use customer attributes to develop a model to predict the total dollar amount that customers are willing to pay**. By translating Matilda's ability to identify patterns into a computational framework, the project will provide an introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for beginners in the field. 

**PROJECT COMPONENTS**

The project is divided into the following parts:

1. Introduction to Neural Networks: A beginner-friendly explanation of neural networks, artificial neurons, and the basics of machine learning.
2. Introduction to the Dataset: Exploring the dataset used in the project, understanding the features and variables that contribute to predicting car sale prices.
3. Data Visualizations: Visualizing key aspects of the dataset to gain insights and understand the relationships between variables.
4. Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
5. Creation of the Model: Building an artificial neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras, inspired by Matilda's intuitive understanding of patterns.
5. Evaluation of the Model: Assessing the model's performance, analyzing results, and interpreting the predictive capabilities of the neural network.
6. Conclusion and Resources for Further Studying: Summarizing key findings, and lessons learned, and providing additional resources for beginners to continue exploring the fascinating world of neural networks.

**DATASET** 

Note: The dataset used in this project was sourced from Udemy.

The dataset contains the following attributes and the goal is that as a car salesman, we would like to develop a model to predict the total dollar amount that customers are willing to pay given the following attributes: 
- Customer Name
- Customer e-mail
- Country
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Salary 
- Credit Card Debt 
- Net Worth 

In summary given the above attributes, the model should predict: 
- Car Purchase Amount

**CONCLUSION** 

The MatildaCarPricePredictor-BeginnersGuide project brings together the magic of storytelling and the power of artificial neural networks, inspired by the whimsical character Matilda from Roald Dahl's world. As Matilda's ability to recognize patterns serves as a guiding light, we've delved into the intricate realm of neural networks, providing beginners with an immersive introduction. Through the lens of Matilda's adventures in the car industry, we've explored the creation of a model to predict car sale prices, bridging the gap between fiction and technology.

**FURTHER RESOURCES** 

Since this was a beginner's guide to neural networks, some areas of further studying can include:
1. **Advanced Neural Network Architectures:** While this project introduced feedforward neural networks, another interesting area to explore is advanced neural network architectures. Dive into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence data, and Transformers for natural language processing to broaden your understanding of specialized network structures.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Hyperparameter tuning is an integral aspect of optimizing neural network performance. Research the art of hyperparameter tuning, understanding techniques like grid search and random search to find the best combination of hyperparameters. Learning how fine-tuning these parameters can significantly impact model effectiveness.




Note: The character of Matilda belongs to Roald Dahl and is featured in the book "Matilda" written in 1988. The images depicting scenes from the project are sourced from the 1996 movie adaptation of the book. The unique quirks and characteristics of the character Matilda are the creative property of the author Roald Dahl. This project uses the character Matilda for creative inspiration and storytelling purposes, and it is not associated with or endorsed by the Roald Dahl estate or any affiliated parties. The primary focus of this project is to explore the integration of Matilda's fictional attributes into the context of artificial neural networks for car price prediction.
